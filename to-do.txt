1. Update enternal_route to be something like "administer_by".  Will require model, schema, crud, main updates and DB reload.
2. Update the prescription_list.json for DB setup.  Need to get the accurate patient ids.  Do after #1.
3. See notes below on mr_form_data submit errors...
4. Style the p-prescript and the mr_form_data sections of medication_request_wf.html
5. Create a logout endpoint, update header link to direct to it. Logout provider and redirect to login on click.
6. Create a profile endpoint, update header to direct ot it. Redirect to profile on click.
7. Write test - start with root/index, then figuring out how to mock db.


Figure out the issue causing current error on submitting mr_form_data:

{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "missing",
      "loc": [
        "query",
        "user_name"
      ],
      "msg": "Field required",
      "input": null,
      "url": "https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.5/v/missing"
    },
    {

    },
    {
